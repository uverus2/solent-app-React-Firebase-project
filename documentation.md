# Solent Collaboration App

## Introduction

Collaboration is an important process which allows for an individual to improve not just their industrial skills but their soft skills as well. Soft skills can be important in a workplace allowing more efficient and effective flow within a team. Important soft skills considered can be communication where an individual would express a problem found within a task, they undertake by distinctively express what the issue might be and how they encountered the issue. 

Business nowadays would prefer employees with strong soft skill to ensure the maximum potential is met. Therefore, graduates and students would benefit from obtaining such skills especially before completing their undertaken degree.

The project Solent Collaboration App was devised to meet those requirements. In previous research (link prev report) it was outlined that universities provide some Collaboratory work however they can benefit from additional projects they can use to display on potential interviews where they can showcase not just their individual abilities but the ability to work within a team. The application was focused on connecting users together and providing the means of organising project information and carrying out the task.

The success of the application however will solely depend on the end users therefore a testing and evaluation stage is required to outline potential problems and future opportunities. However, before a user evaluation is carried out the application must ensure certain benchmarks are met to ensure the ease of use. 

The documentation will focus on testing the application ensuring it is ready for commercial use before usability testing is carried out. Therefore, a tool called Lighthouse will be used to test the general performance and the usability of the application which will be compared to benchmarks that are defined.


## Project Presentation

The creation of the app was solely based on collaboration and ensuring the right individuals are enrolled into the right project therefore admin right was granted to the creator of the project where him/her will act as a manager and select the candidates they believe will be most suitable for that project which again provides more development for one's skill. The application also focused on providing certain features to ensure users can communicate during the development of the project. One such features was the life chat.

On the other hand, the application contain limited features and it was aimed to only showcase project without providing any time management features or document storage. Following, the purpose of this was to ensure the students will explore different tools and research different techniques for managing their projects and time to ensure a student will apply the research abilities obtain from university and use them effectively to achieve a common goal.

The platform could be perceived as a live briefing application which will allow a user to create a brief others can follow or question combining the live chat to ensure all questions regarding the brief are met, issues regarding the projects are mentioned and technologies or tools that will be used to develop or track the project to be discussed.

In terms of UX and UI design the focus was on creation of a task cantered design where a user will find projects easily, keep a collection of the projects they have created or the projects they have joined and a simple search that either displays the roles most suitable for the search or the user can look at all projects created. However, the user will be limited to one role defined upon registration to ensure the maximum simplicity of the application. 

The navigation contains simple four buttons which will guide the user to quick actions that they will require such as viewing and editing their profile or viewing their projects. The reason behind this was to create a very simple and clear navigation that any student can use no matter the course they undertook.

Simple feature to view one’s profile was also established to allow users to gain a little bit more detail about their peers within that project. However, you can only see users’ part of a project without allowing ability for searching users and messaging users privately to ensure minimum data is being exposed. Furthermore, images were not allowed to be uploaded for the same reason.



## Technology and Justification

React JS - It is a component based Javascript framework for building user interfaces [ref](https://reactjs.org). The library is very simple and lightweight framework that deals only with the view layer of an application [ref](https://stories.jotform.com/7-reasons-why-you-should-use-react-ad420c634247). React also provides reusable components structure which can increase the development time of an application as well as provide a more consistent look and easier to maintain codebase [ref](https://stories.jotform.com/7-reasons-why-you-should-use-react-ad420c634247) which is why the framework was used for the project. React will be used in a functional version due to the increased simplicity of defining a function instead of a class and without the need to manage this enabling a more clean and quicker solution [ref](https://tylermcginnis.com/why-react-hooks/).
 
Sass - Is a feature rich CSS pre-processor which allows for SCSS files to split in different sections/folders allowing better organization and easy to debug structure [ref](https://www.mugo.ca/Blog/7-benefits-of-using-SASS-over-conventional-CSS). In the end the multiple scss files can be compiled into a single file [ref](https://alistapart.com/article/why-sass/). SASS also provides numerous of features such as mixins, nesting and variables which allows for a better management and combination of classes allowing clear vision of the purpose of certain styles. 

Firebase - Is a serverless solution to a database approach allowing the management of data in real time plus removing the need of management of the server side of the development process providing a easy and efficient solution [ref](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/what-is-firebase-the-complete-story-abridged-bcc730c5f2c0).

React Hook Forms - Provides a flexible and easy to use form validation with many features such as the ability to pass form error and hooks acting like use effect to monitor changes on the form allowing action to be carried out upon that change [ref](https://react-hook-form.com).

Yup - Combined with React hook forms it extends the validation capabilities for a form. It is a schema builder for value parsing and validation and it works by defining a form schema and validate an existing value based on that schema [ref](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

React Router - It allows for a single page application to be build without the need of page refresh upon navigation which provides a more seamless experience [ref](https://medium.com/@marcellamaki/a-brief-overview-of-react-router-and-client-side-routing-70eb420e8cde).
